# How to make 3D Modles for Museums & Archaeology

Hello and welcome to this day workshop on how to make a 3D scan of British Museum and [Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS)](https://finds.org.uk/) objects. By the end of this workshop, you should be equipped to make a scan like this one of the Terme Boxer's head. We will be covering the basics of a technique called photogrammetry.

This workshop is part of the [Festival of Archaeology](https://festival.archaeologyuk.org/):
