This morning, we'll be trying to make models of objects in the Classical Galleries of the British Museum (Rooms 19-23), to get a sense of the basic photography techniques for large objects and sculpture (hint: the easiest things to scan!). This afternoon we will focus on scanning artefacts and small finds from the the museum's collections and the Portable Antiquities Scheme.

So what can you scan and what can't you scan easily? Well, today you won't be too limited, but photogrammetry does not work well with:

* objects without any texture
* that are flat
* that are very thin
* that are transparent
* that are shiny/reflective
* that are all one colour (eg black)

## Ethics

When choosing subjects for 3D scanning, there are ethical concepts to consider. Luckily today I do not think you will be worried by this. These include:

* cultural sensitivity - religious iconography for instance
* ownership and permission to scan
* copyright of living artists or makers

You should also be aware of museum regulations about photography and how you may use your scans. Some museums are private, and you are entering under strict terms of entry.

## Choose an sculpture in the gallery

We will now walk round the rooms and find a sculpture that has lots or room around it, good lighting and most importantly, you are interested in. Look for one with lots of texture and interesting features, but for this learning process, avoid ones with lots of intricate holes in it or small features. *Busts* are excellent subjects.
