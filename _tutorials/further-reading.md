Thank you for coming to my workshop and getting involved with the Festival of Archaeology. I hope you will now go out and create great 3D. This is a very basic tutorial session and there are far more things to learn. 

If you would like to learn more, I suggest the following reading:

## Raw data to practise with

[Dan Pett (Head of Digital, Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge)](https://creative-economy.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/team/danielpett/) has a large folder on [Google Drive](https://goo.gl/CS5aoN) with hundreds of GB of data for various models. You could use this for practise.
