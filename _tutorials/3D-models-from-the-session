Here's the 3D models produced from our training session on the 24th July 2019!

## Rotating your model on Sketchfab

Simply add *?autospin=.3* to the end of your models url, for example: [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/palstave-hoard-partially-excavated-ca1ec636d82e46bb93391034760276a9?autospin=.3](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/palstave-hoard-partially-excavated-ca1ec636d82e46bb93391034760276a9?autospin=.3)  
Change the number to adjust the speed. This is handy if you want to make a screen recording of your model rotating - handy for making gifs (though Sketchfab has a great tool for that too - see next step!). 

## Making Gifs

Sketchfab has built a handy [gif exporter](https://labs.sketchfab.com/experiments/gif-export/)

Simply go to 'load scene', search for a model or enter your model's url. Choose what resolution you want and hit 'render'- the gif will automatically download when it's done!

Note gifs are only viewable online, but great to upload on websites and social media for engagement purposes. You can also convert into short films, a great way to promote your 3D models!
