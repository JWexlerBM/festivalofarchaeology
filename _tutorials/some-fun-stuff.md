Here's a few other fun things you can do with your 3D models!

## Editing & Annotating your model on Sketchfab
Sketchfab provides a [comprehensive guide](https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/categories/200161407-Editing) on how to render and edit models on their help pages.

For [Annotations](https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/202512456-Annotations) 
How would you edit and build content around your 3D model?

## Rotating your model on Sketchfab

Simply add *?autospin=.3* to the end of your models url - change the number to adjust the speed. This is handy if you want to make a screen recording of your model rotating - handy for making gifs (though Sketchfab has a tool for that too - see next step!). 

## Making Gifs

Sketchfab has built a handy [gif exporter](https://labs.sketchfab.com/experiments/gif-export/)

Simply go to 'load scene', search for a model or enter your model's url. Choose what resolution you want and hit 'render'- the gif will automatically download when it's done!
